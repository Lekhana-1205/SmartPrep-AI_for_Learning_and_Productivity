# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI-powered personalized learning platform is a system that generates adaptive study plans tailored to individual students' needs. The platform uses diagnostic assessments to identify strengths and weaknesses, creates targeted study schedules based on available time, continuously tracks performance, provides actionable feedback, and dynamically adjusts learning paths. The system includes an exam readiness checker to help students prepare efficiently and achieve better exam outcomes.

3. WHEN a student requests progress information, THE Platform SHALL display performance trends over time
4. THE Performance_Tracker SHALL maintain a complete history of all completed learning activities

### Requirement 4: Actionable Feedback

**User Story:** As a student, I want to receive actionable feedback on my performance, so that I know what to improve and how to improve it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student completes a learning activity, THE Feedback_Engine SHALL generate specific feedback based on performance
2. WHEN generating feedback, THE Feedback_Engine SHALL identify specific errors or misconceptions
3. WHEN providing feedback, THE Platform SHALL include concrete suggestions for improvement
4. THE Feedback_Engine SHALL provide feedback within 5 seconds of activity completion

### Requirement 5: Dynamic Plan Adjustment

**User Story:** As a student, I want my study plan to adjust automatically based on my progress, so that I always focus on the most relevant areas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student demonstrates mastery of a weakness area, THE Plan_Adjuster SHALL reduce emphasis on that topic
2. WHEN a student struggles with a topic, THE Plan_Adjuster SHALL increase practice activities for that area
3. WHEN adjusting a study plan, THE Plan_Adjuster SHALL maintain the student's available time constraints
4. WHEN performance data indicates a new weakness, THE Plan_Adjuster SHALL incorporate activities to address it
5. THE Plan_Adjuster SHALL update study plans after every 5 completed learning activities

### Requirement 6: Exam Readiness Assessment

**User Story:** As a student, I want to check my exam readiness, so that I know whether I am prepared to take the exam.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student requests an exam readiness check, THE Exam_Readiness_Checker SHALL evaluate performance across all topic areas
2. WHEN evaluating readiness, THE Exam_Readiness_Checker SHALL compare current performance against target proficiency thresholds
3. WHEN a readiness check is complete, THE Platform SHALL provide a readiness score between 0 and 100
4. WHEN a student is not ready, THE Exam_Readiness_Checker SHALL identify specific areas requiring additional study
5. THE Exam_Readiness_Checker SHALL provide an estimated time to readiness based on current progress rate

### Requirement 7: Time Management

**User Story:** As a student, I want to specify my available study time, so that the platform creates realistic and achievable study plans.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student specifies available time, THE Platform SHALL accept time in hours per day or hours per week
2. WHEN creating or adjusting study plans, THE Platform SHALL respect the student's available time constraints
3. WHEN available time changes, THE Platform SHALL allow students to update their time availability
4. IF a study plan cannot be completed within available time before an exam date, THEN THE Platform SHALL notify the student and suggest time adjustments

### Requirement 8: Progress Persistence

**User Story:** As a student, I want my progress to be saved automatically, so that I can continue learning across multiple sessions without losing data.
